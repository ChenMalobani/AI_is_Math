# EX4: Hough circles
Ex4 raw .py file is available for download as a .zip file [(direct download)](https://github.com/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/raw/master/c_04b_hough_transform/ex4/ex4.zip). Instructions are inside the .py file.

In the ex. we will implement fom scratch Hough transform to detect circles.

This is **a very short assignment**- no more than 20 lines of code...
